# 2048 achievements
A clone of [Gabriele Cirulli's](http://github.com/gabrielecirulli/) [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) with simple achievement system.

My goal is to program 2048 achievements. It's quite a difficult task. So any contributions are welcome.

## Contributing
Fork this repository and go to /js/achievements.js. There you can find existing achievements. Add your achievement following [instructions](https://github.com/FacelessTheOne/2048/blob/gh-pages/ACHIEVEMENTS.md) and then open Pull request. It's that simple.
